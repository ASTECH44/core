FAQ 
======

>**I can no longer edit my design**
>
>If you have put a widget or an image that takes almost the entire design, you must clickk outside the widget or image to access the menu by right-clickking.

>**Delete a design that no longer works**
>
>In the administration part then OS / DB, do &quot;select * from planHeader&quot;, get the id of the design in question and do a &quot;delete from planHeader where id = # TODO #&quot; and &quot;delete from plan where planHeader_id = # todo # &quot;by replacing # TODO # with the design id previously found.
