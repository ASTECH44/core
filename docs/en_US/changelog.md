- Bugfix
- Simplification of access to plugin configurations from the health page
- Addition of an icon indicating if the daemon is started in debug or not
- Addition of a global history configuration page (accessible from the history page)
- Docker bug fix
- Ability to authorize a user to connect only from a computer on the local network

- Reinforcement of error handling on widgets
- Ability to reorder views
- Theme management overhaul

2.1

- Jeedom cache system redesign (use of doctrine cache). This allows for example to connect Jeedom to a redis or memcached server. By default Jeedom uses a file system (and no longer the MySQL database which allows you to download it a little), it is in / tmp so it is recommended if you have more than 512 MB of RAM to mount the / tmp to tmpfs (in RAM for faster and less wear and tear on the SD card, I recommend a size of 64MB). Be careful when restarting Jeedom the cache is emptied so you have to wait for all the information to come back up
- Redesign of the log system (use of monolog) which allows
integration with logging systems (syslog (d) type)
- Optimization of dashboard loading
- Fixed many warning
- Possibility during an API call to a scenario to pass tags in the url
- Apache support
- Docker optimization with official docker support
- Optimization for synology
- Support + optimization for php7
- Jeedom menu redesign
- Delete all network management part : wifi, fixed ip… (will surely come back as a plugin). BE CAREFUL it is not the jeedom master / slave mode which is deleted
- Removed battery indication on widgets
- Addition of a page which summarizes the status of all equipment on battery
- Redesign of the Jeedom DNS, use of openvpn (and therefore of the openvpn plugin)
- Update all libs
- Interaction : ajout d'un système d'analyse syntaxique (permet de supprimer les interactions avec de grosses erreurs de syntaxe type « le chambre »)
- Suppression of the interface update by nodejs (switch to pulling every second on the list of events)
- Possibility for third-party applications to request events via the API
- Refonte du système « d'action sur valeur » avec possibilité de faire plusieurs actions et aussi l'ajout de toutes les actions possibles dans les scénarios (attention il faudra peut-être toutes les reconfigurer suite à la mise à jour)
- Ability to deactivate a block in a scenario
- Addition for developers of a tooltips help system. Il faut sur un label mettre la classe « help » et mettre un attribut data-help avec le message d'aide souhaité. Cela permet à Jeedom d'ajouter automatiquement à la fin de votre label une icône « ? » et au survol d'afficher le texte d'aide
- Change of the core update process, we no longer request the archive from the Market but directly from Github now
- Addition of a centralized system for installing dependencies on plugins
- Redesign of the plugins management page
- Adding mac addresses of the different interfaces
- Added double authentication connection
- Hash connection removal (for security reasons)
- Adding an OS administration system
- Addition of standard Jeedom widgets
- Ajout d'un système en beta pour trouver l'IP de Jeedom sur le réseau (il faut connecter Jeedom sur le réseau, puis aller sur le market et cliquer sur « Mes Jeedoms » dans votre profil)
- Addition to the scenarios page of an expression tester
- Review of the scenario sharing system
